# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

A powerful and accessible **machine learning project** designed to predict the risk of diabetes based on user-provided health parameters. Built entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook**, this project offers an interactive and educational experience for students, developers, and healthcare enthusiasts alike.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This ML-based solution uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to determine whether a person is at risk of diabetes. The model is trained on real-world medical data and performs classification based on key health indicators such as:

* **Glucose level**
* **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
* **Blood pressure**
* **Age**
* **Insulin level**
* **Skin thickness**, and more.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

* 🔍 **Accurate Risk Prediction**
  Built using the Random Forest algorithm to maximize classification accuracy.

* 📊 **Health Parameter Analysis**
  Visualizes data distribution, correlations, and feature importance to improve understanding.

* 🧪 **User Input Simulation**
  Allows manual input in Jupyter to simulate different health profiles and see real-time predictions.

* 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  Includes insightful charts and statistics to better understand the dataset and model behavior.

* 🎯 **Awareness-Oriented AI**
  Aims to support early-stage diabetes awareness through predictive modeling and open-source tools.
